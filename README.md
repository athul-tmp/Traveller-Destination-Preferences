# Project Name: Traveller Destination Preferences Study

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the BuddyMove Data Set, focusing on traveller preferences for various destination types in South India. The data set contains reviews from 249 individuals, with the aim of exploring patterns and trends in destination preferences.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to analyze the destination preferences of travellers using classification algorithms. Specific objectives included:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by verifying data types, handling null values, and selecting relevant features.
2. **Classification Modeling**: Apply classification algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Trees to explore relationships between destination categories.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize data distributions and relationships to identify patterns and trends in traveller preferences.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

- Verified data types and handled null values.
- Selected relevant features for analysis.
- Prepared the dataset to ensure its readiness for classification modeling.
  
2. **Classification Modeling**:

- Utilized K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Trees to model relationships between destination categories.
- Achieved accuracy rates between 79% and 84% using the classification algorithms.
  
3. **Data Visualization**:

- Visualized data distributions and relationships using scatterplot matrices and individual scatterplots.
- Provided insights into patterns and trends in traveller preferences for different destination categories.
  
## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed traveller destination preferences using classification algorithms. By focusing on data preparation, classification modeling, and visualization, the project provided valuable insights into the preferences of travellers in South India, which could inform tourism strategies and marketing efforts.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling tasks.
- **scikit-learn**: Employed for implementing classification algorithms such as KNN and Decision Trees.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data cleaning, preprocessing, and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating visualizations to explore and analyze the data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary environment for conducting analysis, executing code, and documenting the project.
